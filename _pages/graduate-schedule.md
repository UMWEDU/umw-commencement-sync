<h2>Thursday, May 11th</h2>
<strong>9 p.m. – 1 a.m.: </strong>Graduation Ball: Anderson Center, William M. Anderson Center

Seniors and graduate students are invited to a formal celebration with music, food, and a cash wine bar. Dress is formal to semi-formal. Each student will receive two free tickets and are welcome to bring a non-senior or non-UMW student as a date. Information on ticket pick-up will be provided at a later date. The tickets are the only means of entrance for the event and are used to receive a Grad Ball glass at the end of the evening. All attendees 21 + years of age will receive a wristband at the check-in table. The event is for seniors and graduate students who graduated in Fall 2016 or are graduating in Spring 2017. If you have any questions, please contact Student Activities at 540/654-1061 or sae@umw.edu.
