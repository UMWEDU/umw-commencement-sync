&nbsp;

Haider and Davis rose to the top of more than 15,000 nominations from across the country to make last November’s prestigious Forbes “30 Under 30” list of successful young business leaders. Their company, Aspetto – Haider is president and CEO; Davis is COO – sells bulletproof suits and professional attire, and other high-end men’s clothing. The life-saving apparel line has generated millions of dollars in revenue, serving the U.S. armed forces, government contractors, NFL players, reality TV stars and other high-profile clients, and has been recognized by such publications as <em>Esquire</em> and <em>Newsweek</em>.

Haider and Davis, both business administration majors who graduated from UMW in 2012, began creating Aspetto when they teamed up in an international business strategy class at Mary Washington. Their assignment: Invent a product that would be viable in foreign markets.
