A former Virginia delegate and state official, Terrie Suit is chief executive officer for the Virginia Realtors. She began her real estate career in 1985 as a real estate agent and later transitioned into a 20-year mortgage lending career. In her current position, she also has served on multiple committees with the National Association of Realtors.

In 2011, Suit was appointed by Virginia’s Governor as the commonwealth’s first Secretary of Veterans Affairs and Homeland Security.  As an Army daughter and a Navy wife, Suit worked diligently to fulfill the Governor’s goal of making Virginia “the most veteran-friendly state in the nation.” She also received a gubernatorial appointment to the Virginia Real Estate Board in 1996.

Suit served in the Virginia House of Delegates with the 81st District from 2000 to 2008. During her tenure, legislative peers recognized her as an expert on housing policy that included real estate licensure, common interest communities, landlord tenant issues, real estate finance, foreclosure, and building and fair housing issues. As a delegate, she served on a number of committees, including chair of the General Laws Committee, the Housing Sub-Committee and the Virginia Housing Commission.

She earned a master of business administration from Mary Washington in 2016, after receiving a bachelor’s degree from Old Dominion University. Suit also holds the Certified International Property Specialist designation and the Certified Association Executive certification.
