Commencement is a weekend-long series of events celebrating students who are graduating. Communication with students and families before and during the weekend is very important.

There are a variety of events that will take place to assist you in preparing for Commencement. We have everything you and your guests will need to know for the weekend - schedules, maps, parking, seating, disability services, event streaming and more. Make sure to check our Commencement Schedule for specific dates and times.
